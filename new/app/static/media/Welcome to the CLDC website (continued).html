	<p>In addition, CLDC's daily operations are managed by students, whose network education compliments their formal engineering studies. Student operators are responsible for the overall network setup, PC Windows, MAC "choosers," as well as every link, application, modem, operating system, workstation, and printer along the way. Student operators assist users with posting entries to the World Wide Web, the restoration and repair of PC's and providing basic Internet training. <br><br> To enhance training, students are given designated ranks that are loosely based on the Star Trek series. The highest designation, or rank, is "Number 1," which refers to the student with the most CLDC experience. Each student who receives this designation plays a critical role in the operation of CLDC and usually ends up being tthe most sought after by corporations looking to increase their technical staffing levels. <br><br> The concept behind CLDC is very simple: in order to run a modern network on the Internet certain priorities must be met. There must be an intrastructure, such as a fiber cable and hardware; there must exist the expertise to engineer, design, maintain, and change the entire operation; there must be a reserve of common knowledge that is constantly updated and is always in an ongoing cycle of adjustment and intergration; and there must be continuity. <br><br> CLDC had its genesis in an idea that was first conceived of almost 20 years ago. In the late 1970's Howard's School of Engineering developed specialty labs that provided basic technical services for the University's various disciplines. These services included applications that analyzed and simulated various engineering operations. <br><br> Soon after, the civil engineering department assembled mini-networks that produced research into everything from soil modeling to structure supports. And as the other departments followed suit, developing their own custom computer systems, the School of Engineering developed an ad-hoc network. <br><br> Eventually, due to limited resouces and the common need for basic technical services, CLDC was created to serve the combined needs of the University's engineering population. CLDC continued to develop under the leadership of former CLDC Director, the late Dr. Irving Jones, and CLDC's system managers Walter Oliver and Michael Johnson, evolving into an entity that was both generic and specific. That is to say, it began taking on the responsibilities of engineering operations and departmental applicational services. <br><br> In the months that followed, CLDC began to network itself and the School of Engineering along with it. Once a solid network was established, the school followed the natural progression: developing the means to communicate electronically with other engineering schools. And somewhere along the way a plan was fashioned for connecting the University to the newly formed Internet. Since that time, the HUnet has established a national presence, serving almost 3,100 users on Howard's campus alone. <br><br> But while its growth is a tremendous plus for the University, the true value of CLDC lies in its very existence. The future of the Internet is already somewhat determined - it will be the dominant communications media. However, proper staffing expertise must be maintained because the easier a system is for the user, the more specialized it is to operate and manage. <br><br> Howard must not be deprived of that backstage technical view. The University must gain insight into the "whys" and "hows" of the Microsofts of the world. That is the only way to set the price as opposed to merely being able to obtain a good price. <br><br> Howard, as well as the entire African-American community, must explore every opportunity that the Internet presents. The price of yesterday was not knowing; the debt of today is ignorance; the currency of tommorrow will be knowledge. <br><br> Derek Lloyd<br> Network Systems Engineer</p>
